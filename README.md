# House Price Prediction using XGBoost

## Overview
This project implements an *XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)* model to predict *house prices* based on various real estate features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset includes key attributes affecting house prices, such as:
- *Lot Size*
- *Number of Bedrooms & Bathrooms*
- *Square Footage*
- *Year Built*
- *Location & Neighborhood Features*
- *Market Trends*

## Model & Approach
- *Preprocessing*: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and performed feature scaling.
- *Algorithm*: XGBoost Regression for price prediction.
- *Evaluation*: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R² Score.

## Installation & Requirements
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
